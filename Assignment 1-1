# "specdata" is a character vector of length 1 indicating the location of the 
# csv files.

specdata <- ("C:/Users/Christian/Desktop/Coursera/R Programming/Data Sets/rprog-data-specdata/specdata")

pollutantmean <- function(directory, pollutant, id){
  setwd(file.path(directory))
  a <- dir(pattern = "*.csv")
  bout <- data.frame("Date" = as.Date(NA), "sulfate" = NA, "nitrate" = NA, "ID" = NA) 
  
  for(i in 1:length(a)) {
  
  b <- read.csv(a[i])
  b1 <- b
  b2 <- subset(b1, pollutant & ID == id)
 
  bout <- rbind(bout, b2)
  pollmean <- mean(b1$pollutant, na.rm = TRUE)
  }
}

It doesn't run and gives me the following: 
 Error in pollutant & ID == id : 
  operations are possible only for numeric, logical or complex types In addition: Warning message:
In ID == id :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
